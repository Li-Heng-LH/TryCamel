### Some Learning Notes ###
##### What is Camel #####
* Camel is an integration framework. 
* Camel stands for Concise Application Message Exchange Language (the Java DSL for routing)
* a Camel does not require bucket loads of XML as you can use a pure Java DSL
* At the core of the Camel framework is a routing engine â€” or more precisely, a routing-engine builder. It allows you to define your own routing rules. 
* Camel forms the glue between disparate systems.
* One of the fundamental principles of Camel is that it makes no assumptions about the type of data you need to process. 
&nbsp; 
 
##### What is Integration Framework #####
* Integration frameworks provide **a model for interaction and communication** between mutually interacting software applications. 
* Typically provide: **content-based routing**, aggregator, content filtering. 
* **`My Understanding`**: What is system integration? To allow different components of a system to interact and communicate with each other.
